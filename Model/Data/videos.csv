I really wanted to show you how it is done in real life with minimum cropping. I used it as a basis for my own sessions with my boy.

There's a few main ideas in this video:
- Change behavior by redirection
- Show enthusiasm to student
- Eliminate distractions
- Offer a variety of tasks
- Give positive reinforcement
- Use food as reinforcement
- Offer choices to student
- Use timer to facilitate transition
- Give student time to respond
- Use things you already have for your therapy session

Как в реальной жизни проходит сеанс ABA-терапии, почти без вырезки. Это занятие проводил опытный терапевт и я использовала его как базис, на которыя я равнялась в своих занятиях с сыном.

Как видно из видео, есть несхколько основных идей для такой терапии:
 Нежелательное поведение должно быть перенаправлено на другое
Показывайте свой энтузиазм ребенку
Уберите отвлекающие моменты
Проводите занятия структурированно, предлагая различные задания
Предлагайте ребенку позитивные поощрения, в том числе и в виде еды
Используйте таймер для упрощения перехода между занятиями
Предлагайте студенту выбор
Для терапии используйте вещи, которые у вас уже есть в наличии

Joint Attention (shared engagement and enjoyment)

Let’s talk about the building blocks of language…

INTRODUCTION:

- Have you ever wondered how your baby will learn to speak, play and interact with others?

- They start by sharing experiences with their parents. This is known as joint attention.  

- Joint attention occurs in early development and is an essential building block to learning language. 

- Joint attention emerges as early as 2 months and is well established by 18 months of age.","['1to1 Therapy Services', 'Speech Therapy', 'Toronto (City/Town/Village)', 'Joint Attention Child Development Infant Development Language Development', 'Child Development', 'Infant Development', 'Language Development']",2015-09-16,1920,1080,993

A picture exchange communication system is one way to teach someone how to communicate with others using pictures. Since pictures are generally universally understood, this system can be used to request for items, answer questions, comment on the environment, and many more. 
Phase 1 teaches the child to request for a preferred item using a picture icon. In this phase the child will learn how to pick up a picture icon, reach towards the communicative partner (for example,  parent, sibling, family member, therapist), and release it into their hand. 
Phase 2 teaches the child to travel to and from the picture book and to the communicative partner at different distances. 
Phase 3 teaches picture discrimination between the preferred item and other items.

WHY IS JOINT ATTENTION IMPORTANT?

- Why is joint attention so important? 

- Responding to Joint Attention is when your child follows your lead and attends to the same thing as you.

- For example, if you say, “Look!” and point to a ball, your child should look in the direction you are pointing. This is how your child demonstrates joint attention. 

- Joint attention allows your child to learn from others and to share enjoyment with others.

- Initiating joint attention is your child’s ability to use their gaze, gestures, pointing, sounds or words to draw your attention to an object or event. Your child will look at the object of interest and then back to you to learn and share enjoyment. 

- An example is when a child looks up to the sky and points to an airplane and then looks at parent and back to the airplane passing by.

- If your child looks at you to share enjoyment or to see if you are watching him, this is called social referencing. 

- Joint attention is an important milestone for social development as your child is showing interest in not only objects but people and their reactions. 

- Children with autism spectrum disorder be delayed developing joint attention. 
- At 2 months of age, infants display joint attention by taking turns exchanging looks, noises and mouth movements 

- At 6 months, children look in the same direction as others and follow your gaze.

- At 8 months, infants demonstrate pointing

- At 9 months, infants demonstrate gestures and social referencing 

- At 1 year, children point intentionally to share interest 

- At 12-14 months, your child will start to direct your attention by pointing and then look back to you.","['Joint Attention', '1to1 Therapy Services', 'Toronto', 'How-to (Website Category)', 'Tips', 'Child Development', 'Infant Development', 'Health (Industry)']",2015-09-16,1920,1080,3167

The first couple of steps taken in subtraction are the most important because they are the base on which the rest of the steps come, and that's why parents should become very creative with such lessons and choose the right games to play with kids and teach them basic subtraction.

Who does not have play doh in the house for the kids to enjoy playing with? Almost no body and that's exactly the reason why we love to depend on it in so many different ways when it comes to learning. This educational video is about teaching the child basic subtraction through play-doh splat.

With the play doh, make small balls which the child will use to count and subtract - you could create them all in the same color or even in different ones, its all up to you. If you are trying to make it more interesting for the child, you could even let them roll some balls with you before you start the game - or the lesson :-)

All what the parent will do is impose different subtraction equations on the child and let him/her do those equations from the play doh balls. For example, if the equation is 6-1, the kid will then have to bring six play doh balls and place them in front of him/her and then splat the number that needs to be taken away which in this case is one in order to manage bringing the final answer out and solve the equation, which will be 5.

This is a really fun and interesting math game for kids from which they could learn subtraction, it only needs a willing player and the play doh, and everything will be set and ready for the lesson to start. We believe that kids enjoy this method a lot because it depends on their favorite play doh and because they get to splat the balls which they are supposed to take away to get out the final answer.

There are lots of different math games for kids when it comes to addition and subtraction, but every single one will always depend on the age of the child and the facts about numbers that he/she has already learned and could keep up with. Parents should be always careful while they are choosing these math games for their kids because they are the only ones who know where their kids are standing in math.

In addition to these different games, there are also the typical ordinary methods and strategies which are used in teaching kids how to subtract, these make subtraction much easier but they are not done with games or toys. There are those strategies followed on the white board, such as the column method (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcAwwP8PJbg), there is also the removal mental strategy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSYXMxtzGbA), the counting on strategy (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pyB7Sk-ghM) and there are also those different mental math tricks which are related to several other mathematical operations, such as addition, multiplication and division.

This play doh method used with the kids to learn basic subtraction is very easy, fun and challenging, and it always works with the kids because they get to roll the play doh balls themselves, place the number they are asked about, and they are also the ones who will splat the number of balls which they are supposed to remove from the bigger number and bring the final answer.

Challenge your kids, bring them different games and tricks in order to play and learn both at the same time, and let them be the ones in leading the game and putting the rules to feel that they could solve the equations all by themselves.

There are lots of math games for kids to learn subtraction, some are also with play doh while others are not, but they should be always with the right tools that would grab the attention of the child and give them the chance to learn something new.

Play Doh Learning - Writing Letters with Play Doh | Play Doh Game | English Alphabets | Alphabet


Learning to write down the English alphabet letters could be a lot fun, but what are these fun methods? Writing down the letters with the play-doh is one of these exciting and fun learning methods; play-doh is most probably found in every home and it is easy to depend on at the same time.

Prepare different play-doh pieces, a pencil that you are not using, and plan the letters that you want your child to try writing them down. The best thing about using the play-doh is that if one is ruined from the writing, you could easily use another and there are actually different ways or games that could be played with it.

Kids could do different letter shapes out of the play-doh and they could actually write on it as if they are writing on a piece of paper, which will also turn out to be interesting for them because they are not writing on paper as they are used to.

Parents will choose a letter and ask the child to write it down on the play-doh, but before doing that, they should first ask them about the sound that the letter produces and at the same time let them trace the letter in the air with their magic finger in order to show how it should be written down.

To make the whole thing challenging for the child, try changing the way you ask them the question. At the beginning ask them what is the letter that produces a specific sound and then let them write it down, you could also make the movement done with the sound in jolly phonics and ask them what is the letter that represents it, and you could also bring it from the side of asking them what is the letter that their name starts with and also let them write it down. There are lots of different ways to choose the letter which the kids will write down and lots of ways to test their knowledge and memory.

Learning the English alphabet usually comes attached to other steps, such as knowing more about phonics and how the letters should sound, as well as learning to write these letters down correctly through following the same way every single time in order not to get lost at some point.

There are different educational videos on our channel related to teaching the child how to write down the different alphabet letters through different games and activities, such as using the paint or else playing with the play-doh. There is the one related to learning to write down the letter 'a' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HFLwaVW_0U8), writing the letter 'e' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3Vja3_Rvjs), the letter 's' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzwoPNQk1XY), there is also the one related to the letter 'n' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg0bhC0gqRU), the letter 't' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZT8ImgjSA-g) and the letter 'L' (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVL9oskIn10).

The interesting thing about using these different methods is that they not only educate the child and teach them to write and spell the letters correctly, but it also helps with the fine motor skills of the child and give them the chance to improve their thinking skills; how they are going to use the different colors and sizes of the Lego to write a letter, how they are going to deal with the play-doh to create a letter, etc.

Help your child if he/she is finding a difficulty in something and guide them to the right direction and also try to challenge them if they are good at the whole process and know all the answers to your questions, try to see how far they could get and how much they actually know. Challenging the child will bring you to some places you did not even think about or consider before! Kids are really smart.

Don't ever worry if the child doesn't know a specific thing because it all comes with practice.

Learning with play doh can be lots of fun. Use play doh to help your child learn the English alphabet. Make prints of the letters, write ABC alphabet and trace the letters to help your child with their letter formation. A great resources for ks1 phonics and letter writing. Suitable for preschool and kindergarten as well as foundation stage or even those learning English.

XyNTKSm69Gs,UCNjXz1a_K44oBon2lbCtxpw,Turn taking with your toddler/preschooler,High 5 Communication Resources,35,30,720p,128kbps,"This week's #WatchThisWednesday video: How to practice taking turns with your child! Because the #1 thing I hear parents say to their toddler when they're engaging with a friend is: ""Share that toy!"" However, successful turn taking starts with taking turns at home with caregivers! See below for more detailed directions!

ps - I prefer to call it turn taking rather than sharing as this implies the child will get the toy back soon. It helps with the ""anxiety"" involved with sharing toys.e44r

Remember: practice makes perfect! Enjoy and happy turn taking! 

HOW:
1. Engage in an activity in which they are interested. In this video, we were making “block soup” by stirring blocks in a bowl with a big wooden spoon. My guy loves doing this. Other ideas for turn taking include rolling a ball back and forth, flying a toy plane, driving a toy car, playing a toy piano/xylophone, etc. Really, it can be ANYTHING your child is interested in.

2. Allow your child to take the first turn. After 30-90 seconds, take a turn by saying, “My turn. It’s my turn! Give it to me please.” Take the object gently but firmly. 

3. Play with the object in an obviously enjoyable manner (even if you aren't excited to stir that block soup, FAKE IT!). Model an appropriate way to play with the toy. 

Take a SHORT turn playing with the object – and I mean SHORT. When you first begin practicing turn taking, your turn can be as short as 3-5 seconds. If your child gets upset, you may have to hold the object away from them so they can’t grab it back from you. Do not allow your child to take the object back until it is their turn. If they become very upset, make the turn slightly shorter! ****The goal is to get them to feel comfortable giving you the object and to KNOW that they will indeed get the object back after your turn.

4. Let your child take his/her turn. Say, “It’s your turn! Your turn. Here you go. Thanks for letting me have a turn!” Your child’s turn can be longer. If he/she is having a hard time taking turns with you, you’ll want to make their turn significantly longer.

5. Continue as long as your child is interested in the object. Once they lose interest, move on to a new activity.

WHY???
Why would a speech therapist be talking about turn taking?? 

1. First of all, turn taking is a foundational skill for language because if you think about it, a conversation is really just 2 people taking turns talking. 

2. Secondly, you’re practicing social skills with your child (yes, ""speech therapists"" also work on social skills...a lot, actually). If you want your child to learn how to take turns with other children, this is the place to start! When you start with turn-taking practice with your child (rather than with other children), you can maintain control over the situation and give yourself extra short turns and your child extra long turns. The end goal of this activity is to make turn taking feel POSITIVE to your child!

WHO?
An adult caregiver will have the most success practicing turns with your toddler to start. Siblings or other children under the age of 10ish are not a great choice as they will likely want to take longer turns with the toy, and this may end up feeling like a negative experience for your child. 

WHEN? 
It’s best to practice these skills when your child is well rested, fed and in a good mood.","['#WatchThisWednesday', 'turn taking', 'toddler', 'high 5 communication resources', 'speech therapy', 'social skills', 'take turns']",2017-07-12,1280,720,1053
