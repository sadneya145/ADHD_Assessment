                                <p>
                                    We're four computer science and psychology students who came together with a shared
                                    mission: to make ADHD assessment more accessible, affordable, and less intimidating
                                    for families. Our journey began in a cognitive psychology class where we learned
                                    about the challenges in pediatric mental health assessment‚Äîlong wait times, high costs,
                                    and limited availability of specialized clinicians.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    What started as a class project evolved into something much bigger. We realized we
                                    could leverage our technical skills and psychological knowledge to create tools that
                                    genuinely help families. NeuroAssess is the result of months of research, development,
                                    and collaboration with psychology professors, clinical experts, and most importantly,
                                    families affected by ADHD.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    We're not clinicians, and we don't pretend to be. Instead, we see ourselves as bridge-builders‚Äî
                                    creating technology that connects families with the information and resources they need
                                    to seek appropriate professional help. Our platform is designed to be a starting point,
                                    a way to gather preliminary data that can inform conversations with healthcare providers
                                    and potentially reduce the time and cost of formal evaluation.

                                    This project has been an incredible learning experience for all of us. We've delved deep
                                    into cognitive neuroscience, learned about the ethical considerations in healthcare technology,
                                    and most importantly, developed a profound respect for the families navigating ADHD.
                                    Every feature we build, every line of code we write, is motivated by the hope that we
                                    can make someone's journey a little bit easier.

                                    <strong>NeuroAssess is a screening and educational tool, not a diagnostic instrument.</strong> We are
                                    students passionate about mental health technology, not licensed clinicians. Our platform
                                    is designed to provide preliminary information that can inform conversations with healthcare
                                    professionals, but it cannot and should not replace comprehensive clinical evaluation.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If our tools suggest potential ADHD symptoms, we strongly encourage you to consult with
                                    qualified healthcare providers including pediatricians, child psychologists, or psychiatrists.
                                    Only licensed professionals can provide an official ADHD diagnosis and recommend appropriate
                                    interventions.
                                </p>

                                    We've worked hard to ensure our assessment tools are based on sound scientific principles
                                    and validated research. However, we continuously seek feedback from clinical experts and
                                    users to improve our platform. If you're a healthcare professional interested in
                                    collaborating or providing feedback, we'd love to hear from you.

                                    While NeuroAssess started as a college project, we envision it growing into a comprehensive
                                    resource for ADHD awareness and assessment. Our goals include:

                                        and ensure they meet clinical standards

                                        <strong>Expanding language support</strong> to make our platform accessible to non-English

                                    We believe technology can democratize access to mental health resources without replacing
                                    the essential human element of clinical care. Our vision is a future where no child's
                                    ADHD goes unrecognized simply because their family couldn't afford assessment or didn't
                                    know where to turn for help.
